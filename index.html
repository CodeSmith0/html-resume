            <h1>A Brief Note</h1>
            <p>
                I went to school for software development at Moraine Park Technical College for a semester.
                During that semester, I took classes that went over topics such as HTML, CSS, Java, and Microsoft SQL Server. 
                Overall, I was disatisfied with the lack of instruction, and I taught myself everything. I concluded
                the semester with a 4.0 GPA, but I decided that I could better prepare myself for the workforce through self education.
                I am currently writing this resume as I progress through a Web Development course on Udemy, and I have learned more in less than a week than
                I did with a semester at college.
            </p>
            <h2>Education</h2>

                I have a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, and I graduated with a cumulative GPA of 3.62 in 2022.
                I also took a semester at Moraine Park Technical College in their Software Developer program in 2023, and I finished the semester with a 4.0 GPA. 
                I am currently enrolled in a Udemy course to further my understanding of Web Development as well.
